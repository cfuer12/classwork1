# classwork1

I have cleaned some of the HTML and CSS files that were given to me. Basically 
made certain links work again and took out some added footers that were added to the page. I also formated the given file so the semantic elements were in the correct order. I organized the given CSS files to compress most of the classes that were on it since the original document was really cluttered. 

Screenshots of the webpage is provided in the repository.
